## Statistics

- **Total Size**: ~13.14 GB
- **Total Files**: 380 TIFF images
- **Exposure Settings**: 10000 and 20000
- **File Format**: TIFF

## Usage

These images are stored using Git LFS (Large File Storage) due to their size.

### üö® Important: Cloning Instructions

**You MUST have Git LFS installed to properly download the images:**

```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS (one-time setup)
git lfs install

# 2. Clone the repository (this downloads image pointers, not full files)
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

# 3. Download the actual image files (13.14 GB download)
git lfs pull
```

### Alternative: Clone with LFS files immediately

```bash
# Install Git LFS first
git lfs install

# Clone and download all LFS files in one command
git clone <repository-url>
# LFS files are automatically downloaded during clone if LFS is installed
```

### Verification

Check that you have the actual images (not just pointers):

```bash
# Image files should be ~35MB each, not just a few bytes
ls -lh "2025-06-17 acquisition/exposure10000/grabbed_image_101.tiff"
```
